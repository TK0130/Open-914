# Open-914
Soon to be open source library of mechanical parts compatible with the Porsche 914. The goal is to make it easier to work on this car and to give information on any oddball parts that may not be clearly documented elsewhere.

As I restore my porsche 914 I will be uploading any parts I design here for others to use. I do plan to monetize the models at first to recover my NRE costs but once that is done I will be open sourcing all the models.

If a part is listed, that means I have a cad model of it. Once I sell enough of each part to make it worth my time, I will post the CAD models (and continue to sell the part.)
